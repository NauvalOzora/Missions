                    <h3>Creating a Unique Personal Design Style</h3>
                    <p>We’re all scrambling to be different and own our own slice of the design scene. Because of 
                        trends and the type of design that we’re exposed to, we all end up consuming the same art and 
                        influenced by the same design. Thus, we end up making work that looks similar.

                        the exciting world of augmented reality (AR). AR enriches your physical environment with an overlay

                    <p>The definition of augment is to "make (something) greater by adding to it." Augmented Reality (AR) 
                        is technology that sets out to do just that by adding a layer of data over the physical world. AR

                    <h3>Design System Fundamentals</h3>
                    <p>Design systems create a bridge between designers and developers. They describe the rules, constraints, 
                        and principles of your company’s design language. Design systems aren't exactly new. If you've ever

                    <h3>Getting started with design research</h3>
                    <p>Design research is the systemic investigation of users and their needs. It employs various methodologies 
                        that will help you make more informed decisions when building your products.

                    <p>The moment from sign-up (or download) to actual use is the most important ‘moment’ in any product’s design.

                    <p>One of the larger open questions in our industry is how to prove the value of our work – especially when others might think 
                        it’s hard to measure. Why do we keep hearing about ways to pull up a seat at the table ? Why do so many businesses still hire

                        You can take comfort in knowing that the designers who made whatever it is you’re drooling over also had to figure out how to close

                        Xcode before in this context.

                    <p>The design of your idea – its simplicity, usability and ability to hook and delight people – is the reason your product could 
                        succeed when others fail. But design isn’t just about color swatches, logos or the placement of buttons and labels. It’s

                    <p>The importance of user-centered design is well-established. This blunt statement from Dieter Rams says it all: "In my eyes, 
                        indifference towards people and the lives they lead is the only sin a designer can commit." But it's a significant challenge

                        in scannability, save space at smaller screen sizes, and afford clear, tappable targets. That said, icons can cause user

                    <p>Design is (by nature) a subjective thing. It's also a team sport. When making design decisions about look or feel or content, 
                        disagreement is common and tensions can emerge. So how do you decide what "good" is for your product?

                    <p>One of the key principles of design is visual hierarchy, which encompasses almost everything you’ve learned on Hack Design so far. 
                        Whether you’re dealing with screen or print media, you have content—words and images—that needs to be organized into a layout.

                    <p>No matter what visual style is hot, no matter what great product you're using, every piece of good design uses "white space" 
                        well. I'm using this as a blanket term, not only to mean "negative space," (or places where there just isn't any stuff,

                    <p>Color is a powerful form of communication. We are so attracted to color and so repelled by it that even if the coolest 
                        design were presented to us, if we didn't like the color, we wouldn't like it at all.

                            <p>Typography has always been at the foundation of design &amp; communication. We're at an interesting point in time
                                 where we're being given previously unknown amounts of control over our work, but also new &amp;

                            <p>When we look back at black and white movies, we marvel at the results they could achieve without color. 
                                Despite this, we can agree color film was a good invention: you can still shoot in black and white, but color
                                gives an extra dimension and opens up a lot of new avenues for ...

                            <p>A few weeks ago we were introduced to the art of type, and gained a basic understanding of the rules surrounding it. 
                                But where does it all fit in? Of what value is typography to the interfaces we interact with on a regular basis?

                                Great workers blame their tools too! If they're not performing, they should be blamed. You simply can't do your best

                            <p>In this lesson, we'll dive right in and learn a few quick – but really important – rules about typography. 
                                Before we start the course, let's define typography quickly. Typography can simply be described as the art of type. 
                                It's everything you can think of – like fonts, sizes, ...

                            <p>Why design? What purpose does it serve? It's not purely aesthetic, nor wholly analytical and functional. 
                                When considering the design of your projects, you must think about how everything fits together in harmony - some
